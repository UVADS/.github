> The [University of Virginia School of Data Science](https://datascience.virginia.edu/) — the first of its kind in the nation—is guided by common goals: to further discovery, share knowledge, and make a positive impact on society through collaborative, open, and responsible data science research and education. Founded in fall 2019 through the largest gift in UVA history, the School positions the university and our community to play a national and international leadership role in the global digital future.
